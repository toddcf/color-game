## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Challenges / What I Learned

- Gained better proficiency with JavaScript event listeners.
- Learned how to add event listeners to individual elements using a for loop.
- How to add CSS styles to elements using JavaScript, either by adding and removing classes, or by adding the styles directly in the JavaScript code.
- How to use the modular design pattern to abstract different tasks into separate functions and then call those functions at the correct time, resulting in cleaner code.

## Future Iterations

- Clean up the mobile responsiveness. Right now it's functional on all screen sizes, but the message board design has room for improvement on the smaller screens. I'd also like to shrink the RGB text on smaller screens.
